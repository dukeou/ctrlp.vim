BASIC USAGE

    * Press <c-p> or run :CtrlP to invoke CtrlP.
    * Press <c-f> <c-b> while CtrlP is open to switch between find file, find buffer, and find MRU file modes.
    * Ever remember only a files name but not where it is? Press <c-d> while CtrlP is open to switch to filename only search.
    * Press <c-r> while CtrlP is open to switch to full regexp search mode.
    * End the input string with a colon `:` followed by a number to jump to that line in the selected file.  
        e.g. "abc:45" will open the file matched the pattern and jump to line 45.

BASIC OPTIONS

    * Change the mapping to invoke CtrlP:

        let g:ctrlp_map = '<c-p>'

    * When CtrlP is invoke, it automatically sets the working directory according to this variable:

        let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 1

        0 - dont manage working directory.  
        1 - the parent directory of the current file.  
        2 - the nearest ancestor that contains one of these directories or files:
            .git/
            .hg/
            .bzr/
            _darcs/
            root.dir
            .vimprojects

    * You can also use the set-working-directory functionality above outside of CtrlP by adding the following line to your vimrc.  
      The parameter is the same (0, 1 or 2):

        au BufEnter * cal ctrlp#SetWorkingPath(2)

    * Enable/Disable Most Recently Used files monitoring and its functionalities:

        let g:ctrlp_mru_files = 1

Run ":help ctrlp" for more mappings, commands and options.
