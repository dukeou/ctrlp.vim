BASIC USAGE

    * Press <c-p> or run :CtrlP to invoke CtrlP.

Once CtrlP is open:

    * Press <c-f> <c-b> to switch between find file, find buffer, and find MRU file modes.
    * Press <c-d> to switch to filename only search.
    * Press <c-r> to switch to full regexp search mode.
    * End the string with a colon ':' followed by a Vim command to execute that command after opening the file. If you need to use ':' in the command, escape it with a backslash: '\:'.
      e.g. 'abc:45' will open the selected file and jump to line 45.
             'abc:/my\:function' will open the selected file and jump to the first instance of 'my:function'.
             'abc:+setf\ myfiletype|50' will open the selected file and set its filetype to 'myfiletype' then jump to line 50.
    * Submit two dots '..' as the input string to go backward the directory tree by 1 level.
    * Use <c-n>, <c-p> to go to the next/prev string in the prompt's history.
    * Use <c-y> to create a new file and its parent dirs.

BASIC OPTIONS

    * Change the mapping to invoke CtrlP:

        let g:ctrlp_map = '<c-p>'

    * When CtrlP is invoke, it automatically sets the working directory according to this variable:

        let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 1

        0 - dont manage working directory.  
        1 - the parent directory of the current file.  
        2 - the nearest ancestor that contains one of these directories or files:
            .git/
            .hg/
            .bzr/
            _darcs/
            root.dir
            .vimprojects

    * You can also use the set-working-directory functionality above outside of CtrlP by adding the following line to your vimrc.  
      The parameter is the same (0, 1 or 2):

        au BufEnter * cal ctrlp#SetWorkingPath(2)

    * Enable/Disable Most Recently Used files monitoring and its functionalities:

        let g:ctrlp_mru_files = 1

    * If you want to exclude directories or files from the search, you can use the Vims option wildignore.
      e.g. Just have something like this in your vimrc:

        set wildignore+=*/.git/*,*/.hg/*,*/.svn/*   " for Linux/MacOSX
        set wildignore+=.git\*,.hg\*,.svn\*          " for Windows

Run ":help ctrlp" for more mappings, commands and options.
