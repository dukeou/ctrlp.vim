BASIC USAGE

    * Press <c-p> or run :CtrlP to invoke CtrlP.
    * Or run :CtrlPBuffer or :CtrlPMRU for find buffer and MRU mode.

Once CtrlP is open:

    * Press <c-f> and <c-b> to switch between find file, buffer, and MRU file modes.
    * Press <c-d> to switch to filename only search instead of full path.
    * Press <c-r> to switch to regexp mode.
    * End the input string with a colon : followed by a command to execute after opening the file.
         e.g. abc:45 will open the file matched the pattern and jump to line 45.
    * Submit two dots .. as the input string to go backward the directory tree by 1 level.
    * Use <c-y> to create a new file and its parent dirs.
    * Use <c-z> to mark/unmark files and <c-o> to open them.

BASIC OPTIONS

    * Change the mapping to invoke CtrlP:

        let g:ctrlp_map = '<c-p>'

    * When CtrlP is invoked, it automatically sets the working directory according to this variable:

        let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 2

        0 - dont manage working directory.
        1 - the parent directory of the current file.
        2 - the nearest ancestor that contains one of these directories or files:

                .git/
                .hg/
                .bzr/
                _darcs/
                root.dir
                .vimprojects

    * If you want to exclude directories or files from the search, you can use the Vims option wildignore.
      Examples:

        set wildignore+=*/.git/*,*/.hg/*,*/.svn/*   " for Linux/MacOSX
        set wildignore+=.git\*,.hg\*,.svn\*         " for Windows

    * Use a custom file listing command with:

        let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'find %s -type f'       " MacOSX/Linux
        let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'dir %s /-n /b /s /a-d' " Windows

Run ":help ctrlp" for more mappings, commands and options.
